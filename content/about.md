## Introduction

I am Htet Aung Shine. I am a polyglot developer from Singapore. I love lifting heavy weights and have a weakness for Shiba Inus. I am currently going through part-time Computer Science degree at Nanyang Technological University while working full-time as a developer.
I started my journey into computers when I was eleven with Visual Basic and Windows XP. I spend most of my time writing Python, Javascript, Golang and quite comfortable with them. I consider myself an experienced full-stack developer with a huge interest in writing performant code. 

## What can you find on this blog?

I will not be writing much since I am currently going through school with a job on the other hand. I will be sharing my knowledge and findings. If my articles have helped you in one way or another, this blog will have served its purpose. Shoot me a tweet if you find them useful!
